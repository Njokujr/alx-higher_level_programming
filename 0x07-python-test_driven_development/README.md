# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development.

# Learning Objectives

	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without 	      the help of Google.

# General
. Why Python programming is awesome
. What’s an interactive test
. Why tests are important
. How to write Docstrings to create tests
. How to write documentation for each module and function
. What are the basic option flags to create tests
. How to find edge cases

# Python Test Cases
. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
. All your files should end with a new line
. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
. All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
. All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
. All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
